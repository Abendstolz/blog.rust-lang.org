The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.31.0. Rust is a
systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.31.0 is as easy as:

```bash
$ rustup update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can [get `rustup`][install] from the
appropriate page on our website, and check out the [detailed release notes for
1.31.0][notes] on GitHub.

### Library stabilizations

Three APIs were stabilized this release:

* [`Arc<T>::downcast`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html#method.downcast)

Additionally, you can [now compare `&str` and
`OsString`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51178/).

See the [detailed release notes][notes] for more.
